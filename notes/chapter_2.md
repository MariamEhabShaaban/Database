<h2>Data Models</h2>
<p>a collection of concepts that can used to describe the structure of database to achieve abstraction .there are three types of data models :</p>
<ul>
  <li>High level or conceptual data model :
  <p>provides concepts that are close to the way many users preceive</p></li>
    <li>Low level or physical data model :
  <p>provides concepts that describes the details of how data is stored</p></li>
    <li>Representational data model :
  <p>provides concepts that may be easily understood by end users but are not too far from the way data is organized on computer ex:
   <ul>
      <li>relational data model</li>
      <li>hierarchical data model</li>
      <li>network data model</li>
   </ul>
     
    
  </p></li>
      
</ul>
