    # Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) Modeling
    
    ## Concepts:
    
    - Subclasses / Superclasses
    - Specialization / Generalization
    - Categories ( UNION types )
    - Attribute and relationship inheritance
    
    ## Subclasses / Superclasses :
    
       in many cases an entity type has different subgroupings of its entities that are  
    
          meaninigful and need to be represented explicity
    
    - Subclass ⇒ Subgrouping
    - Superclass ⇒ Entity
    - Local Atrribute ⇒ attribute for one of subclasses
    
    ## Specialization
    
    is the process of defining subclasses of a superclass
    
    - **Reasons to specialize:**
        1. some attributes may not allow to all superclass
        2. some relationship may allow to some of subclass
    
    ## Generalization
    
    - Generalization is the process of extracting common properties from a set of entities and creating a generalized entity from it. It is a bottom-up approach
    - collect attributes which common in subclasses to superclass
    
    ## Constraints on specialization and generalization
    
    - **Disjointness**
        - entity member at one subclass only ( d ) character
        
        Overlapping ⇒ entity member at more than one subclass ( O ) character
        
        ![disjoint.gif](disjoint.gif)
        
    - **Competeness**
        - the superclass must be a member of some subclasses.
        - show in EER by a double line
    
    Hierarchy ⇒ every subclass has one superclass ( single inheritance )
    
    Lattice ⇒ Subclass may have more than one superclass ( multiple inheritance )

    ## Categories (Union of super-classes)
    
    - It is a method to collect super-classes in entity to connect it with other relationship and entities
    - show in EER diagram by ( U )
    
    shared class ⇒ intersection between superclasses

    # The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constrains
    
    - The relational model represents the database as
    a collection of relations. Informally, each relation
    resembles a table of values. A row represents a
    fact that typically corresponds to a real-world
    entity or relationship.
    - In the formal relational model terminology:
        - the table is called ⇒ a relation.
        - a column header is called an ⇒ attribute
        - row is called ⇒ a tuple
        
        ## Formal definitions- schema:
        
        - A relation schema R (description of relation),
        • Denoted by R(A1, A2, ... , An),
        • R is the name of relation
        • The attributes of relation R are A1, A2, ... , An.
        • Each attribute Ai is the name of a role played in the relation schema R.
        • D is called the domain of Ai and is denoted by dom(Ai).
        • The degree of a relation is the number of attributes n of its relation schema.
        • Ex. Customer(id, name, address, phone)
        • Customer >> relation name
        • Four attributes (id, name, address, phone)
        • Each attribute has a domain or set of valid values
        • Ex. The domain of id is 6-digit numbers
        
        ## Formal definitions-Tuple:
        
        - Each n-tuple t is an ordered list of n values t =<v1, v2, ... , vn>,
        • Each value vi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is an element of dom (Ai ) or is a special NULL
        value.
        • The ith value in tuple t, which corresponds to the attribute Ai , is
        referred to as t[Ai ] or [t.Ai](http://t.ai/) or t[i].
        • Ex. Row in customer relation is 4-tuple and consist of four values as:
                  <123,“ahmed”,”ttttt”,”(02)589256”>
        • A relation is set of tuples (rows)
        
        ## Formal definitions-Domain:
        
        - Domain ⇒ set of valid values and atomic values
        - ( atomic ⇒ indivisible)
        - To specify a domain is to determine a data type
        - Some examples of domains follow (domain has logical definitions, has data type or format
        
        <aside>
        💡
        
        Domain Example:
        
        Usa_phone_numbers. The set of ten-digit phone        numbers valid in the United
        States.
        
        </aside>
        
        ## Formal definitions -State:
        
        - The relation state is a subset of the Cartesian product of the
        domains of its attributes.  r(R) ⊆ (dom(A1) × dom(A2) × . . . × (dom(An))

        ## Characteristics of Relations:
        
        - Ordering of tuples ⇒ are not considered to be ordered
        - Ordering of attributes ⇒ are not considered to be ordered but its values should be ordered as the header
        - Values in tuples ⇒ ( atomic - from the domain - may be special NULL value)
