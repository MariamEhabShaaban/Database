    # The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constrains
    
    - The relational model represents the database as
    a collection of relations. Informally, each relation
    resembles a table of values. A row represents a
    fact that typically corresponds to a real-world
    entity or relationship.
    - In the formal relational model terminology:
        - the table is called ⇒ a relation.
        - a column header is called an ⇒ attribute
        - row is called ⇒ a tuple
        
        ## Formal definitions- schema:
        
         A relation schema R (description of relation),
        
        - Denoted by R(A1, A2, ... , An),
        - R is the name of relation
        - The attributes of relation R are A1, A2, ... , An.
        - Each attribute Ai is the name of a role played in the relation schema R.
        - D is called the domain of Ai and is denoted by dom(Ai).
        - The degree of a relation is the number of attributes n of its relation schema
        - Ex. Customer(id, name, address, phone)
         Customer >> relation name
         Four attributes (id, name, address, phone)
         Each attribute has a domain or set of valid values
         Ex. The domain of id is 6-digit numbers
        
        ## Formal definitions-Tuple:
        
        - Each n-tuple t is an ordered list of n values t =<v1, v2, ... , vn>,
        - Each value vi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is an element of dom (Ai ) or is a special NULL
        value
        - The ith value in tuple t, which corresponds to the attribute Ai , is
        referred to as t[Ai ] or [t.Ai](http://t.ai/) or t[i].
        - Ex. Row in customer relation is 4-tuple and consist of four values as:
                  <123,“ahmed”,”ttttt”,”(02)589256”>
        - A relation is set of tuples (rows)
        
        ## Formal definitions-Domain:
        
        - Domain ⇒ set of valid values and atomic values
        - ( atomic ⇒ indivisible)
        - To specify a domain is to determine a data type
        - Some examples of domains follow (domain has logical definitions, has data type or format -

        💡
        
        Domain Example:
        
        Usa_phone_numbers. The set of ten-digit phone        numbers valid in the United
        States.
        
        </aside>
        
        ## Formal definitions -State:
        
        - The relation state is a subset of the Cartesian product of the
        domains of its attributes.  r(R) ⊆ (dom(A1) × dom(A2) × . . . × (dom(An))

        ## Characteristics of Relations:
        
        - Ordering of tuples ⇒ are not considered to be ordered
        - Ordering of attributes ⇒ are not considered to be ordered but its values should be ordered as the header
        - Values in tuples ⇒ ( atomic - from the domain - may be special NULL value)
        
        ## Relational Integrity Constraints:
        
        1. Key constraints
        2. Entity integrity constraints
        3. Referential integrity constraints
        4. Domain constraints
        
        ### Domain Constraints:
        
        - The value of an attribute is limited to its domain
        - A domain can impose rules on both formats and valid value ranges
        - Every value in tuple must be from the domain of its attribute ( or it could be null , if allowed for that attribute )
        
        ### Key Constraints:
        
        - Superkey: of R is a set of attributes SK of  R with the following condition : for any distinct tuples t1 and t2 in r(R) t1[SK] ≠ t2[SK]
        - Key of R : minimal superkey ,that is a key is a superkey K such that removal of any attribute from K will lose yhe uniqueness property
        - Any key is a superkey ( but not vice versa )
        - Any set of attributes that includes a key is a superkey
        - if a relation has several candidate keys , one is chosen to be the primary key
        
        Sometimes sequential numbers are created as keys as called artificial key or surrogate key
        
        ### Referential Database Schema:
        
        - A set of relation schemas that belong to the same database
        - S is the name of the whole database schema
        - S ={ R1,R2,….Rn}
        - R1,R2,….Rn are the names of the individual relation schemas within the database S
        
        ### Entity integrity constraints:
        
        - The primary key attributes PK of each relation schema R in S can’t have NULL  values in any tuple of r( R )
        
        ### Referential integrity constraints:
        
        - Tuples in the referencing relation R1 have attributes FK ( foreign key) that reference the primary key attributes PK of the referenced relation R2

        ### Other Types of Constraints:

        ### Populated database state:
        
        - Each relation will have many tuples in its current relation state
        - The relational database state is a union of all the individual relation states
        - Whenever the database is changed a new state arises
        - Basic operation for changing the database:
        1. INSERT  a new tuple in a relation
        2. DELETE an existing tuple from a relation
        3. MODIFY an attribute of an exisiting tuple
